# Five_Day_Weather_App


## Description

This is a 5 day weather app that utilizes the openweathermap.org api.  The user is instructed to enter a city and state abbreviation (Example: houston tx). The next step is to click the [Search for your location] button. This will query the openweathermap.org api for weather data for the chosen city and state. The almost vertically centered main display will show today's date, current time, temperature in farenheit, wind speed and humidity.

In the bottom right area is a forecast for the next 5 days. In these boxes will be displayed the date, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
